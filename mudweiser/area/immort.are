`WEgg`c, the guardian of the `Bchambers`c watches over you closely`w
~
Scales of white, some sharp, others smooth and hardened like shell armor.
Five horns protrude from the skull, three curl like rams horns, two on each
side, and one curled back over the top of the head.  The other two curl in
countermotion, and protrude outwards and up to the sky.  Hooked spinal bones
run down the back between shoulderblades and down the tail.  Standing on two
massively muscular hind legs, this tarrasque is completely white.  It
remains quiet, and still, watching everyone pass through the mist and
careful to keep mortal eyes away from Immortal acts.  So named `WEgg`w for
its unusual white skin and scales, this charmed pet of the gods looks truly
menacing.

The Eye of the Hurricane~
The shrieking winds of a monstrous storm surround you, spinning you around
in an endless web of fury. But then, in the middle of turmoil, you find a
strange calm. You find yourself hovering in the calm eye of a hurricane. All
around you you can see the desruction caused by the powerful storm. White
hot flashes of lightning flicker from the depths of the hurricane.  But
everything is strangely peaceful in here, with the sun shining in from above
and a flock of birds winging across the sky.  You stretch out and relax, this
storm is going to be here a while.

The proud and lonely silence of Mare Imbrium surrounds you, as you gaze upon
the sterile splendor of the moon.  All around is the velvet curtain of night,
studded with a thousand gleaming jewels.  Below you hangs the beautiful
fields of Earth, looking fragile and far away, but full of hope.  A sense of
wistful regret touches you, as you think about what might have been, and what
will be.

Tia's Study~
Books, more books then you can possibly imagine cover every available
inch of space, save for the small path leading to an antique writting desk
in the corner.  Books from every time period in history overflow from the
cluttered bookshelves and into stacks on the floor.  Despite the clutter,
the room has a cozy feel to it, with a small fire burning in the fireplace
set flush with the wall.  Looking around, you can see the great deal of
knowledge and wisdom contained in these volumes, and you wonder what a
Goddess of deceit would find so interesting.  Then you notice the small
plaque on the wall.

plaque~
The plaque is wooden, well worn, and appears to be hand carved.  The
words of wisdom look back at you: Mans greatness is not found in his armies,
for all men have armies.  Mans greatness is found in his ability to stop
war, seek truth, and find courage instead.

desk~
The desk is old, but looks to be well taken care of.  There are various
qwill pens, paper, and reference books scattered about the top as if Tia was
recently looking for something of importance.

A Sea Cave~
You are in a small cave in the cliff next to a deep green sea.  Fine
gold and pink sand blanket the floor.  Shells are scattered and strewn
about.  A blow hole in roof of the cave allows beams of light to stream
in and illuminate the cave.  The wind blows outside the entrance, but
you are protected from the weather in your cozy cave.  The foamy surf
never seems to quite reach your feet.  Several boulders here have been
worn by time into a shape similar to a comfortable chair.

Asgard~
You stand on a huge expanse of glass.  Below you are clouds and the pains
of mortality.  As you stand in Asgard, home of the bravest of the brave, you
are frozen in awe of the power held within these walls.  A huge mansion lies
to the east behind a magnificant set of golden doors.  Vandals have broken
in and painted 'Order of Chaos' all over the walls here.

Standing on the mortal end of the Rainbow Bridge, the bridge arches up

wise to venture upward into the realm of the gods.  But it seems so calm

This is the room Feroz frequents most often.  Along one wall is a
counter.  Closer inspections of this counter shows that Feroz definitely
likes his beverages.  You see Snapple bottles, Pepsi cans, Tea Bags, Coffee
Jars, and several drinks that are unfamiliar to even you.  On one side of
the counter a very large stack of glasses, coffee cups, and an ice machine. 
A hole in the northern wall allows you to see into Feroz's Kitchen.  And to

Feroz's Main Office~
This room is a hectic mess.  Piles of notes overflow out of the todo
list, as they should from the todo list of any active IMP.  A collection of
the notes made by mortals is kept in a rollodex on Feroz's desk.  A large
computer hums away.  The hard disk may hold 1.  6 gibabytes of stuff but
Feroz has somehow filled it up without a single program over 10 megabytes. 
The desk and rollodex are joined by numerous pens and pencils that Feroz
likes to chew on while he works.  The desk os made of solid cherry and still
has a sweet smell as if it is straight from the factory.  The floor around
the small trash can is littered with cans and bottles of various drinks that
can't be recycled, while the recycling bin is overflowing with Mountain Dew
cans.  Various doors lead in every direction, each one accidently left open
as Feroz went running off to another important activity of some sort.

The Swamp~
The cool wind is refreshing and the starry night sky brings a cool to
you.  Three frogs sit on lilypads, their croaking is melodic and soothing. 
One croaks, "MUD!"  Then another croaks, "weis" to another beat.  The third
then starts croaking, "er."  They three frogs croak to a different tempo and
by chance, the three syllables become one word: MUDweiser!!!  This startles
you from your dream and you awake on the floor of the bar.  Most of the
patrons have left and near your mouth you see a large puddle puke that must
be your own.  You remember having a few beers, but not this many.  It always
seems to turn out like this...  
Friends don't let friends drink and MUD!

The Beginning~
In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.  Now the earth
was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the
Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.  And God said, "Let there be
light," and there was light.  God saw that the light was good, and he
separated the light from the darkness.  God called the light "day," and the
darkness he called "night."  And there was evening, and there was
morning--the first day.  And God said, "Let there be an expanse between the
waters to separate water from water."  So God made the expanse and separated
the water under the expanse from the water above it.  And it was so.  God
called the expanse "sky."  And there was evening, and there was morning--the
second day.  And God said, "Let the water under the sky be gathered to one
place, and let dry ground appear."  And it was so.  God called the dry
ground "land," and the gathered waters he called "seas."  And God saw that
it was good.  Then God said, "Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing
plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to
their various kinds."  And it was so.  The land produced vegetation: plants
bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in
it according to their kinds.  And God saw that it was good.  And there was
evening, and there was morning--the third day.  And God said, "Let there be
lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let
them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years, and let them be
lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth."  And it was
so.  God made two great lights--the greater light to govern the day and the
lesser light to govern the night.  He also made the stars.  God set them in
the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth, to govern the day and the
night, and to separate light from darkness.  And God saw that it was good. 
And there was evening, and there was morning--the fourth day.  And God said,
"Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth
across the expanse of the sky."  So God created the great creatures of the
sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according
to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind.  And God saw
that it was good.  God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and increase in
number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the
earth."  And there was evening, and there was morning--the fifth day.  And
God said, "Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds:
livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each
according to its kind."  And it was so.  God made the wild animals according
to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the
creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds.  And God saw
that it was good.  Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, in our
likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the
air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that
move along the ground."  So God created man in his own image, in the image
of God he created him male and female he created them.  God blessed them and
said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number fill the earth and subdue
it.  Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every
living creature that moves on the ground."  Then God said, "I give you every
seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has
fruit with seed in it.  They will be yours for food.  And to all the beasts
of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on
the ground--everything that has the breath of life in it--I give every green
plant for food."  And it was so.  God saw all that he had made, and it was
very good.  And there was evening, and there was morning--the sixth day.

The End~
Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as
crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb down the middle of
the great street of the city.  On each side of the river stood the tree of
life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month.  And
the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.  No longer will
there be any curse.  The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city,
and his servants will serve him.  They will see his face, and his name will
be on their foreheads.  There will be no more night.  They will not need the
light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them
light.  And they will reign for ever and ever.  The angel said to me, "These
words are trustworthy and true.  The Lord, the God of the spirits of the
prophets, sent his angel to show his servants the things that must soon take
place."  Behold, I am coming soon!  Blessed is he who keeps the words of the
prophecy in this book."  I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things.
And when I had heard and seen them, I fell down to worship at the feet of
the angel who had been showing them to me.  But he said to me, "Do not do
it!  I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers the prophets and
of all who keep the words of this book.  Worship God!  Then he told me, "Do
not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, because the time is
near.  Let him who does wrong continue to do wrong let him who is vile
continue to be vile let him who does right continue to do right and let him
who is holy continue to be holy."  Behold, I am coming soon!  My reward is
with me, and I will give to everyone according to what he has done.  I am
the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. 
Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the
tree of life and may go through the gates into the city.  Outside are the
dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral, the murderers,
the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.  I, Jesus,
have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches.  I am the
Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star."  The Spirit
and the bride say, "Come!"  And let him who hears say, "Come!"  Whoever is
thirsty, let him come and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the
water of life.  I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this
book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues
described in this book.  And if anyone takes words away from this book of
prophecy, God will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in
the holy city, which are described in this book.  He who testifies to these
things says, "Yes, I am coming soon."  Amen.  Come, Lord Jesus.  The grace
of the Lord Jesus be with God's people.  Amen.

The End of Time~
You are surrounded by an empty void.  One could get really bored except
for the strange building you are in.  Gaspar, the Guru of Time is asleep in
the middle of the room and to the northwest are many gates to different time
periods in the history of the world.  To your northeast is a door.  On the
other side of that door is Seppuku, the Master of War.  To your west is a
jar of magical refresh water and a save point and to your east a portal to
the Day of Lavos.  To your south is a bridge that extends to some sort of
flying vehicle dock.  You don't see a vehicle there and you wonder what type
of vehicle would be in the end of time.

Reception~
This is where mortals come to wait for an audience with the almighty
Kyle.  The entire room is covered in bloodstains and occasional body parts. 
Three chairs are available to sit in, but looking closer, you notice that
they are covered with irregular bumps.  This entire room makes you want to
leave.  Maybe that's why it's here?  
 
To the north is Kyle's office.  Better get permission before going there.

This is the private office of everyone's favorite implementor.  A large
desk of solid gold fills most of the room, and behind it lies a large gold

This office is intended for Kyle to meet with other lower-ranking
immortals.  Two comfortable chairs are on either side of a desk, and there
is a sofa against a wall.  Down is the mortal meeting room, and up is the

Immortal Guild of Standards~
This room has been dedicated to the persual of a standard system on
the mud.  All the books and charts around you are meant to give all
immortals a standard to judge creation from.  That way, balance can be
more easily maintained and everything is much more organized.  Look
at the `rbooks`w for information on MUD standards.

quest~
`rQuest Commands`w - These commands should never be played with, and should
rarely be used outside of a Quest/RP environment.
 
`mForce `w- `yTo be used to give life to mobs, but once again, emphasis is
        placed on not "playing" with such a command.
 
`mEcho `w -`y Echo should not be abused.  Such an example is "echo You are hungry."
        Echo should be used only to remain anonymous to a user, or in personal
        chat with another immort, unless it is within supervised RP.  Be aware
        that impersonating another user by using echo is against the rules.
        Also be familiar with rules concerning `mAt`y (read 2Dem).
 
`mMurder `w- `yDo not play with or abuse this command.  It should be reserved
         for quest/RP useage, and occasionally smiting very annoying people.
         In either case, this should be accompanied in quest application
         notes or messages on the Immboard, respectively.
 
`cAll levels are responsible for reading the `rdisclaimer`c.
Levels 94 and above should also be familiar with and `rread Dem`c and `r2Dem`c.
~
E
2dem~
`mAt     `w- `yDo not use this command to try and trick players, or confuse
         them into believing you or something else is in the room.  Also,
         do not use this to reveal locations of other players.  The same goes
         for the extended abilities of `mWhere`y and `mMwhere `ywhich also
         should not be used to give players any unfair advantage.
 
`mNochannel/noshout/noemote/notell `w-`y Do not play with these commands or
         use them to act out personal vendetas.  In any case tho, if these
         are left "on" after a player quits, a note should be posted on the
         Imm board explaining the reasons for the action along with if you
         will allow other Imms to remove or change your settings.  Remember,
         disciplinary actions on morts should *always* be handled by the
         same Imm who implemented them.
 
`cAll levels are responsible for reading the `rdisclaimer`c.
Levels 94 and above should also be familar with and `rread Dem`c and `rQuest`c.
~
E
ang~
`mPeace `w- `yIf a newbie is in trouble, and doesn't yet understand the
        concepts of the game, you may use this to avoid unnecessary confusion.
        However, do not randomly go around and use it on people that are
        experienced players, since, this would defeat the point of playing
        on a MUD.
 
`mVnum  `w- `yYou may use this to find eq that you want to wear, but do not
        use it to tell characters what is avaliable, or what mobs can be
        found for the purpose of giving players an unfair advantage.
 
`cAll levels are responsible for reading the `rdisclaimer`c.

In the new MUD structure, only four levels of Administration will be shown
on the wholist to the mortals.  The following list shows the new break

`mSupreme     `w- `yLevels `m99`y and `M98`w

`cJunior      `w- `yLevels `c94`y, `g93`y, and `G92`w
 
`W{`bCouncil`W}`w will be made up of levels `W100`w - `b97`w.  This group of
administration has been formed to discus critical changes involving the MUD.
Duties of the Council will be discussed in more detail in a new section

`YHeroes`w (level 91) are not part of our administration.  `rRead 91`w & `rHER

her~
`mHolylight `w-`y A hero or immort of ANY level should never use this command
            to expose other players, or in anyway that might be detrimental
            to the RP environment we are trying to encourage.  (ie don't
            scream out who's invisible just because you can see them.)  Use
            discretion and maturity.`w
 
`mImotd     `w- `yThe information listed in this command is not to be
            announced or shared publically.  It is only for administration
            to discuss and know.`w
 
`cAny and all commands can and will be taken away from any level if they are
found being abused or if the user is acting innapropriately.`w

dem~
`mTeleport/Transfer `w- `yImms should `rNEVER`y assist players in getting from point
           A to point B by means of a transfer.  Use of transfer should be
           be limited to jailing/releasing user or for speaking with morts
           (and if such a conversation is held, the mort should be
           returned to where they were before transfer.  Use `mWhere`y)
 
`mWizinvis`w - `yWizinvis should not be used to snoop on mort conversations.  Such
           invasion of privacy is grounds for deletion.  Also, Imms are not
           allowed to be in mortal areas for the afore stated reasons.
 
`mPurge `w- `yJust like `mPeace`y (read ANG) this command should only be used
        to "clean" a room.  For example, if someone has left a pet or a
        group of charmed mobs in a room they can not leave.  Do not use
        this command to any one players advantage.

`k  `w
`gRESPONSIBILITIES`w:  Level 91, though listed on the immortal list are still
considered mortals.  They are not a part of the administration of this MUD.
Heroes should continue to RP with the other mortals.
 
`rRULES`w:  Heroes, because they have been rewarded with minor Imm commands,
are responsible for not abusing those commands.  Heroes should hopefully be
an example of good RP to other players.  In some cases, one who reaches level
91 may be considered for future Immship, however there is no gaurantee of
this happening.
 
`rRead HER`w for command restrictions and regulations of this level.
~
E
92~
`GAvatar `b(`yAVA`b)`w, `mLevel 92`w: `cJunior*`w
 
`gRESPONSIBILITIES`w:  The first duty of an Avatar is to represent the
Immortal community with maturity and kindness.  Although they do not
possess all the commands necessary to be a full fledged newbie helper, they
should strive to be polite and helpful to the mortal community.  Also
this level should act as a lookout for troublemakers and help report
bugs or problems.
 
`rRULES`w:  Although the commands given to Avatars are minimal, care should
be taken not to use them to give the imm or any player an advantage.
This level can be looked at in two different ways. One is that of a brand new
Immortal, someone that has been promoted from mortal status to the lowest
administration level until they have shown appropriate interest and maturity
to be considered for a higher level.  Or, because this is the lowest level,
it can be used for probationary status for Imms that have been misbehaving.
However, this is rare, as immaturity and abuse of imm commands is darkly
frowned upon.
 
`rRead AVA`w for command restrictions and regulations for this level.

E
93~
`gAngel `b(`yANG`b)`w, `mLevel 93`w: `cJunior**`w
 
`gRESPONSIBILITIES`w:  Angels are Newbie helpers.  They should strive to
educate newcomers about how to play, what the rules are, and the concepts
of Role Playing.  Level 93 imms are here to assist the mortal community,
hence they do not have wizi.  They should also help report bugs and to
contribute to the evolution of the MUD.
 
`rRULES`w:  Level 93 should at all times, strive to be helpful to the morts,
especially the newbies.  Even tho the imms tend to jest quite a bit,
Angels shoud try their hardest to be polite ambassadors, and should
refrain from unnecessary rude or cruel comments.  Also, because you are 
interacting with morts, it is imperative that you don't help beyond explaining
rules, how to play.. etc.  Such as giving secret tips and hints or extra
eq, gold.. etc.
 
`rRead ANG`w for command restrictions and regulations for this level.
~
E
94~
`CDemi-God `b(`yDEM`b)`w, `mLevel 94`w: `cJunior***`w
 
`gRESPONSIBILITIES`w: Level 94 is something of a "standard" level for immorts who
have shown responsibility, hard work, and interest in the MUD and its affairs.
The primary duty of a Demi-God is user control.  A Demi-God insures that
troublemaking users who go out of their way to harass people are dealt with.
This mean dealing with spammers, people who are a nuisance, people who break
the rules (in any form), or people who generally misbehave in any way.  A level
94 has all the necessary commands to effectively silence and imprison a user.
 
`rRULES`w: Level 94 is the first level in which an immort gets any "significant"
commands.  Hence, the potential for abuse is quite high.  This, Demi-God's are
watched pretty closely (keep that in mind).  No Demi-Gods should abuse or "play"
with their imm commands.  Any user who seems to be misbehaving should first be
warned of such behavior, and then, if such behavior continues, should be
punished accordingly.  All Demi-Gods should also be familiar with the rules on
proper prison use (`rread prison`w).
 
`rRead Dem`w, `r2Dem`w, and `rQuest`w for command restrictions and regulations for
this level.

95~
`mImmortals `b(`yIMM`b)`w, `mLevel 95`w
 
`gRESPONSIBILITIES`w: Level 95 is something of a reward to Demi-Gods who have
shown consistent hard work, effort, and good sense for an extended period of
time.  Such hard work and devotion to the MUD is rewarded (be aware that
asking "Can I be level 95?" or bickering in any way about levels means we
won't even consider a promotion).  Immortals share the main duties of the
Demi-Gods below them with but a few differences.  It is assumed that an immort
at Immortal level would have enough of a sense of responsibility to handle
certain imm commands that have a very high potential of being abused.  Hence,
Immortals are allowed use of string, sockets, freeze, disconnect, gecho, stat,
and snoop (among other commands).  Additional duties of an Immortal include
keeping an eye out for multiplayers (through use of socket and snoop) as well
as being ready to snoop a user suspected of harassment or cheating.
 
`rRULES`w: Overall, an Immortal should show appropriate responsibility for the
level given.  This means not playing with or abusing the commands they have
available to them.  Most rules that apply to an Immortal lie in the individual
command use.  Hence, all Immortals should be VERY aware of the command
restrictions and regulations for their level.

ruling on all issues.  The main duty of an Implementor (beyond financial
support) is to provide necessary coding assistance.
 
`rRULES`w: Yes, even the head bosses have rules.  All Implementors
must discuss major MUD changes in meeting with all Level 97+ immorts
before putting such changes into play.
When a meeting is not possible, news of a crucial change should be
reported in a personal note to the aforesaid immorts.
Examples of "crucial changes" include promotions, demotions, rule changes,

prison~
A `r*USER PRISON*`w is a designated area for the detainment of
troublemakers...  Any mortal found in such an area is `rNOT`w to be removed
unless you put them there yourself or you are a level 98+ and have a DAMN
good reason to remove them...  Prisoners who continue to hassle players from
prison using either channels, shouts, or tells are to be nochanneled,
noshouted, or notelled accordingly.  If they continue to cause trouble,
report them to a higher immortal.
A `r*USER PRISON`w may be used by any level 94+ that has good reason to
imprison or detain a user.  Be forewarned however, that you remain
responsible for your actions and jailing innocents is frowned upon here.
Finally, prisons are NOT TO BE USED as chat rooms.
 
`m** ALL ADDITIONS OR REMOVALS FROM PRISON SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED **
               ** BY A NOTE ON THE IMMORTAL BOARD **`w
`rNOTE`w: Make sure the user has nothing that they can kill themselves with.
 
Current available prisons include:  `rAbyss`w, `rScales`w, and `rBlackhole`w
To imprison a user, simply use "`ytrans <user> <prison name>`w"

`WClassification Keywords for Building and Searching for Objects and Mobs`w
 
     The following chapters include keywords, that should be included in the
NAME field of edit building.  More than one might apply and should be added.
These keywords are used for searching for specific Objects and Mobs, based
on several different catagories.
     Objects are based upon the Type field and have been separated into
three chapters and a total of eight catagories.
`RObjClass1`w:  (null) - Objects with only one type.
            (Food) - various types of edible objects.
           `G*`w(Drink) - various types of thirst-quenching objects.
`RObjClass2`w:  (Weapon Class) - wielding keywords
            (Weapon Special) - Extra flags on weapons
            (Extra) - those dealing outside of regular play.
            (Unusual) - Objects that fall outside of the Type field.
`RObjClass3`w: `G*`w(Specific) - Objects with secondary qualifiers.

`mPoofin/out `w- `yAlthough these commands are, for the most part, a fun 
             addition to being an Imm, one should not make them offensive or
             let them resemble parts of the game.  (ie, The cityguard has
             arrived with Kyle)`w
 
`mGoto       `w-`y An essential command for all Imms and very useful.  The
             only restriction is that Imms should not use this command to try
             and find walking paths, secret rooms, hidden objects, other
             players, etc .. for the purpose of helping ANY mortal for
             ANY reason.
 
`mImmtalk    `w- `yDon't spam :>  Other than that, please make a note that
             formal conversations (anything dealing with policy, morts, etc)
             should not be repeated or discussed publically.  Use discretion
             and maturity.`w

disclaimer~
`r                             **Disclaimer**`y
 
Any and all commands can and will be taken away from any level if they are
found being abused, be that for means of amusement, personal vendetas, or
if the Imm is acting in an overall immature manner.  Each and every level
is responsible for knowing the rules, responsibilities and command
restrictions and regulations for his/her level and all those below his/her
assigned level.
 
Be aware that most commands are logged.
 
If any Imm, of any level, suspects "foul or immature" use of another Imms
commands, it should be reported to `rCouncil`y, or if in the case of the
irresponsible Imm is 97+ to a solitary Implementor for private discussion.
Just as there is a Law of Parties in real life, failure to report and/or
aiding or assisting in poor behaviour will result in disciplinary actions
such as removal of commands, demotions or Imm status being completely revoked.

a party, plush carpeting to crash on.. a nice deep blue to hide chip crumbs

mini bar and kitchen to whip up the perfect munchie.  And what pad would
be complete without a big screen tv.. 50"!  With a satellite dish and a

A Great view of the world.~
You enter the room and the view continues on forever. Little flakes of snow
fall from the sky and softly land on your head. West is a massive forest of
giant trees. Piles of snow has covered the ground completely and it is freezing.
But none of that matters. Tiny bits of grass reach out of the ground and
are crushed beneath the weight of a Mammoth. The sunlight glints off the snow
covering the brown fur of the Mammoth.

`B-`W*`B-`W*`B-`W*`B- Immortal Counsel Chambers -`W*`B-`W*`B-`W*`B-`w~
Upon passing through a refreshing, tingling shell of mist, a cool soft
light surrounds your body and welcomes you into the chamber.  The `Kwalls`w
seem to continually shift and change appearance to resemble endless textures
and styles of construction.  A large oval `Ktable`w dominates the center of
the room.  It is here where new ideas are hatched, and old quarrels are
discussed and settled.  At the four cardinal points rest four magnificent
`Kthrones`w.  Three of obvious splendor and size, and a fourth slightly
smaller for the implementors assistant.  Flanked around the table between
the thrones, rest several `Kchairs`w of unique design.  Each one signifies
the immortals' personality and responsibility.  Hovering above each chair is
a small glowing globe, giving light to a small area around the chair.  In
addition, five larger globes swirl around each other like a slow atom, high
above the table near the top of the dome.

The mist seems to fade in and out in the shape of a large throne.  You
can't seem to make out any details.  It rests at the head of the great
table, across from Feroz's Throne.  Apparently the owner of this throne
hasn't had time to finish constructing his rest/work space.

of felt.  Someone has sit on it for long periods of time leaving a definite

At each of the cardinal points rest four outstanding thrones, one smaller
than the other three, around the table.  Each one is flanked by two globes
of light, who's colour changes with the preferance of the owner.  They
have a very powerful feeling to them and yet an eerie security of control.

table~
The shell of mist appears to rise in a smooth columnar motion to support
a gigantic oval table top with a hole in the center.  The mist pushes up on
the inner edges, slides underneath and swirls back down to the ground.  A
dim bluish gold light emminates from within the mist, resembling a starry
dusk sunset from the edge of the earth.  The table top resembles a marbled
mixture of electrolized titanium and black granite, smoothed to a perfect
polish.  The hole in the center appears to resemble a mirror, or a large cut
of crystal laid over silver.  When a new subject is discussed, the center
mirror glows softly and produces a hologram of all relevant material.  The
great table looks fairly new, but a quiet hum reveals vibrations to the ears
of immortals that it has stood the test of time.  
~
E
walls~
Glancing around the shell of mist, you feel enclosed in a blanket of
complete privacy.  The chamber is very spacious to allow each immortal to
rest and work in a comfortable atmosphere.  The mist pulsates a bit,
continually changing colour and texture, along with design.  For a moment,
the mist builds into gigantic columns, and slowly blends from white to what
seems to be very real carved limestone.  A few smaller bundles of the mist
flock each of the columns, and large broadleaf ferns appears.  The scene
lasts for a few moments, and then just as quietly and quickly as it was
built, the columns and plants dissapear.  The mist fades from a dull white
and peach and blends perfectly into a dark red.  The mist builds straight
lines which become tall flying butresses and chair rails of a rich
mahoghany, forcing the room to resemble an aspe.  Once again, the chamber
walls hold still, keeping the illusion, and then break free and shift into
yet another form.  From caves to rooftops, and buildings of all sorts, the
walls never cease adapting to the personalities of those within its shell.

This chair is coverd in a faint silver stardust.  On the back of it you
can make out "Caitlynne's Chair of RP Rules" in a spidery silver
handwriting.  The chair itself is finely crafted out of stars and silver
framing.  It shimmers in the light with brilliant flashes of silver beams. 
Every so often, a star falls from the body, creating a beautiful startburst
as it slowly shimmers to the ground and fades away.

th_feroz~
This throne constantly shifts and changes in accordance with the whims of
it's owner.  Sometimes a soft bed will suit his tastes, other times it is a
large chair, or a hole in the ground or even nothing at all.  Each form
flickers and phases into and out of reality, causing your head to spin.  You
try to avoid looking, but your eyes are drawn towards the strange throne of
the man that has moods that must change similarly.  On different occasions
punishment, thanks or help will all take place while he rests here.  All of
these things are done to his fullest potential.  And because of his work,
this magnificent throne belongs to one who is insightful, ingenious,
intelligent, just and moral.

ch_malystryx~
A dark wooden chair, made from a single piece of twisted wood and inlaid
with hundreds of priceless gems.  A warm feeling radiates from it and you
feel drawn closer, like an object you have always yearned for, but never
found.  It's markings swirl hypnotically, and you start to loose your grip
on reality.  The chair seems to be the smallest among those at the great
table, but is still taller than the tallest giant.  You feel awed in its
presence.  The sight of it gives you a feeling of enlightenment, like a
trusted teacher giving you the first lesson in a long awaited class.

The chair before you is of rather average design in structure with a
checkered seat pattern.  In a hidden compartment at the bottom of the chair
is a spare cream pie and a small bottle of setzer.  The back of the chair is
engraved with the design of a "Z".  The arms of the chair are in the shapes
of arms making fist, one holding a small scepter.  On the head of the
scepter is a tiny face wearing a golden Jester's hat.

A large throne, compsed completely of highly ticklish chicken feathers
rests across the table from Magius's throne of burning magic.  The whole
throne screams "TICKLE ME TILL I CRY!"  .  A big crown of feathers rests on
the seat, which, itself seems to sway in a light breeze.  It looks to be
some sort of sadistic torture chair for a clown.
