For example: (No examples needed).
2. No modern trademarks, cartoon characters, product names, etc. are allowed.

example: STUDBOY, MILKMAN, or PEPPI.
7. Anything Offensive to the Implementers.  For Example: Case by Case
Basis.
8. _Do_ TRY to choose a MEDEIVAL type of NAME.  If you have any questions
regarding the acceptability of a certain name, feel free to ask an Immortal
for input and guidance.  NO sci-teck or 'space' names are accepted.

-1 GATE~
 Gate <name>                                                   spell 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 The gate spell is a powerful transportation magic that opens up a   
 portal between your character and another person or creature        
 somewhere else in the world.  This portal will transport you and    
 any pet you might have, but not other members of your group.        
                                                                     
 Monsters recieve a save against gate, and monsters or players more  
 than 3 levels higher than you can not be gated to at all. God       
 and private rooms cannot be gated to, and no recall rooms cannot be 
 gated out of.  Finally, all gods are immune to gate.

-1 FLEE~
  FLEE                                                             
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the   
 fight is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE (You can also      
 RECALL, but this is less likely to work, and costs more experience  
 points than fleeing).                                               
                                                                     
 If you lose LINK during a fight, then your character will keep      
 fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your       
 chances of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much    
 more experience.

0 DEATH~
  DEATH                                                   
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of
the Temple of Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where
you were killed, together with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays
with you.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is half-way
back to the beginning of your level.  Thus if you have a bad day and
die several times, the penalties won't clobber you.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with
them. Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes
of real time). Only the player who died, or someone in the same group,
can retrieve objects from a player's corpse.
~

0 RAISE EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
  RAISE EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  The amount of
xp needed to gain a level depends upon how many creation points you
spend during character creation.  

You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

There is a small amount of random variation in the amount of xp you
recieve from killing a certian mobile, although it is fairly
consistant.

You may type LEVEL or LEVELS at any time in the game to get a listing
of how much xp you need to reach the next 4 levels in the game.

To raise a level, type RAISE when you have negative experience to your
next level.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may own only one pet at a
  time, after the old one dies you may purcahse a replacement.

~
 
-1 TICK~
  TICK
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including
  combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration,
  spell duration, weather, and area resetting.

  Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly
  called the 'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real
  time, but the actual amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to
  45 seconds.

  Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the
  area; less often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that
  objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone is in
  the area when it resets.

-1 CAST~
  CAST
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

  Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you
  practice, the higher chance you have of success when casting.
  Casting spells costs mana. The mana cost decreases as your level
  increases.

  The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use
  an appropriate default target, especially during combat.

  If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the
  spell name. Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional
  for single-word spells. You can abbreviate the spell name.

  When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving
  throw. The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the
  victim makes the saving throw successfully.

  See also the help sections for individual spells.

Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are
responsible for the actions of your followers, and others who attack
your followers will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you
directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE SIT~
  REST SLEEP STAND WAKE SIT
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: rest
        sleep
        stand
        wake
        sit

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.  You can use SIT to place your
bottom upon a piece of furniture on the mud or sit on the ground.

Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a
message to all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even
if they are sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote
''' is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY
will work even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their
identity. This is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal
players.

  TANK
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The tank is the enemy of your enemy (ie, who your enemy is attacking).
In most cases this is you, however if you are in a group and one member
attacks a mob, the mob will attack him back.  Then, if you assist that
group member, HE is still the tank, and HE still takes damage from the
mobs attacks.  

Use the %t prompt code to display the tank's current condition when 
grouped, and you will know if he needs to be RESCUED.  When you are 
not grouped, %t will show your current status, or nothing if you are
not fighting.

~

0 WIMPY~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: wimpy
        wimpy <number>

WIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that
reduces your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically
attempt to flee. You will only flee if your character is not in a wait
state -- i.e. has not been using combat commands like cast, trip and
bash, and has not been tripped or bash by an enemy.

WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit
points.

Some monsters are wimpy.

~

0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: buy <object>
        buy [#] <object>   [Note: Multiple Buying]
        list
        sell  <object>
        value <object>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper.

When multiple items of the same name are listed, type 'buy n item',
where n is the position of the item in a list of that name.  So if
there are two swords, buy 2.sword will buy the second.  You may buy
multiples of items by using an optional number value before the object
name.

LIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
List <name> shows you only objects of that name.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.
~

0 SACRIFICE JUNK DONATE~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: sacrifice <object>
        junk <object>
        donate <object>

SACRIFICE offers an object to the gods, who may reward you.
The nature of the reward depends upon the type of object.

JUNK is the same as SACRIFICE, except that it takes obects from your
inventory.  Be careful with this, the gods will not hear complaints
about mistakenly junked eq.

You may DONATE equipment to the needy.  It will remove the equipment
from your inventory and place it one room east of recall.
~

0 SCROLL~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: scroll
        scroll <number>

This command changes the number of lines the mud sends you in a page
(the default is 24 lines).  Change this to a higher number for larger
screen sizes, or to 0 to disabling paging.
~

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: brandish
        quaff    <potion>
        recite   <scroll> <target>
        zap      <target>
        zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion
(as opposed to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites
a magical scroll; the <target> is optional, depending on the nature
of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a magical wand at a target.  If the target
is not specified, and you are fighting someone, then that character
is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have
a single charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a
magical object has no more charges, it will be consumed.

These commands may require an item skill to be succesful, see the help
entries on the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.
~

0 CONSIDER~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: consider <character>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.
Of course, it's only a ROUGH estimate.
~

0 VISIBLE~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
~

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character
every 15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere, although there is an
experience penalty for quitting outside of Midgaard.  When you re-enter
the game you will be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with
just one command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.
If you get into the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you
play some other mud that doesn't save before quitting, you're going
to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to
leave.

~

0 RECALL /~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: RECALL
Syntax: /

RECALL prays to the gods for miraculous transportation from where you
are back to the Temple of Midgaard.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for
fleeing), and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for
fleeing).  This chance is based on your recall skill, although a 100%
recall does not insure success.

RECALL costs half of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters
afflicted by a curse may not recall at all.

~

0 SPLIT~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: SPLIT <amount>

SPLIT splits some gold between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the gold after a kill.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: STEAL coins <character>
Syntax: STEAL <object> <character>

STEAL attempts to steal coins, or an object, from a character.

There are penalties for using STEAL on other players.

In order to STEAL successfully, you must practice the appropriate
skill.

~

0 PRACTICE~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in
all the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this
anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum between 80%
and 100%, depending on your class.  You must be at a guild master to
practice.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.

For more important info, type HELP GAIN
~

0 TRAIN~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: train <str int wis dex con hp mana>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase
mana or hp by 10.  You receive one session per level.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
WIS and CON higher before practising or training anything else.

For more important info, type HELP GAIN
~

0 GAIN~ 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: gain list
        gain points
        gain convert
        gain <skill>

Gaining is a method of getting new skills after the initial character 
is created.  It can also be used to reduce the amount of exp required
per level.

GAIN LIST lists all the skills and spell groups you can gain, and their
costs in training sessions.

GAIN POINTS lowers your creation points by one, and costs 2 training 
sessions.

GAIN CONVERT converts 6 practices to one training session.

GAIN <skill> gives you that skill or spell group.
~

100 ADVANCE~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

100 TRUST~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar
to advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no
effect on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to
mortal (or immortal) characters to give them access to more power
without messing up the character.  You can also restrict a player's
trust to less than their natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~

98 ALLOW BAN~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: allow   <site>
Syntax: ban     <site>
Syntax: ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list.

The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

Site bans are not saved; every time the server is rebooted, the site
ban list is cleared.
~

99 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: reboot
Syntax: shutdown

Reboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

Never, ever, shutdown the mud without consulting Kyle.
~

96 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: wizlock
Syntax: newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to MUDweiser.  Wizlock
locks out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 91), except for link-dead
players who are returning.  Newlock only locks out new character
generation, typically used for preventing a spammer from returning.
Wizlocking should be avoided, and newlocking should be accompanied by
mail or a note to Kyle.

A god must be at least Supreme level to wizlock the game.
~

99 DENY~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: deny <name>

Deny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their
character name unusable.  It may only be removed by editing the file,
for this reason freeze is usually preferred.
~

97 DISCONNECT~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: disconnect <name>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the
telnet prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and
annoying players.
~

97 FREEZE~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: freeze <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a 
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
~

93 FORCE~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.

Below level 97 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all
is unavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example. 

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~

96 SOCKETS~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: sockets
        sockets <name> 

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server,
including users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside
brackets are the channel number and the 'connected' state.  The
'connected' states are listed in merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero
values are various states of logging in.

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can
be used to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of
anyone switched into an orc).
~

94 LOAD~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: load mob <vnum>
        load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to 
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the
vnum command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they
are put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the
god. Old format objects must be given a level argument to determine
their power, new format objects have a preset level that cannot be
changed without set. (see also clone, vnum, stat)
~

98 SET~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax:  set mob   <mobile> <field> <value>

         set room  <number> <field> <value>
         set skill <char>   <name>  <rating>
         set skill <char>   all     <rating>
         set char  <name>   <field> <value>

The set command is used to change the numerical values of the various
data structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing
of options.

Set skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the
value given.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.
(see also string, stat)
~

95 STRING~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: string obj  <field> <string>
        string mob  <field> <string>
        string char <name>  <field>  <string>

The string command changes the various strings associated with an
object or mobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string
obj, string mob, or string char.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not
yet supported.
~

95 NOCHANNEL NOEMOTE NOSHOUT NOTELL~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: nochannel <character>
        noemote   <character>
        noshout   <character>
        notell    <character>

Noemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the
victim from using any of the channels (gossip, auction, Q/A, music)
on the game.

Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.
~

97 PARDON~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: pardon <character> killer
        pardon <character> thief

Pardon pardons a player for their crimes.  Don't pardon a player unless you
are sure they deserve it.  Being killed by Bob acts as an automatic
pardon.
~

96 PURGE~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: purge
        purge <character>
        purge <object>

Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes
all the NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument
purges one character from anywhere in the world.

Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE
flag set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Hassan).  Mobiles
and objects may be purged if they are called directly by name.
~

96 RESTORE~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: restore <character>
        restore room
        restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to
the target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every
player in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players.
Restore all is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore
should be used sparingly or not at all.
~

97 SLAY~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: slay <character>

Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw.  Best not to use
this command on players if you enjoy being a god.
~

95 TRANSFER TELEPORT~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: transfer <character>
        transfer all
        transfer <character> <location>
        transfer all         <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans
all should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room
can have horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for
transfer.

~

94 AT~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).
~

94 ECHO GECHO PECHO~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: echo  <message>
        gecho <message>
        pecho <character> <message>

These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message
to all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of
who sent it.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the
game, and pecho sends the message to the player specified as the
target.  Any higher-level god will see a prompt in front of your
message, informing him or her that it is an echo.
~

92 GOTO~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: goto <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain
god level.
~

93 HOLYLIGHT WIZINVIS~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: holylight
        wizinvis <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will mke you invisible to all players of
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 60 characters are totally 
invisible.
~

93 MEMORY~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: memory                                    

Memory reports the size of your mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and
objects, not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These
strings have a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is
no limit on the number and size of these blocks.
~

96 VNUM~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: vnum <name>
        vnum <obj or mob> <name>
        vnum skill <name>

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints
out the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This
vnum is very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number
(for set) and the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name.
(see also load)
~

93 STAT~                                             
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: stat <name>
        stat mob  <name>
        stat obj  <name>
        stat room <number>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or
room within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return
a object (if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does),
or a room (if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the
room you are standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.
(see also goto, transfer)
~

93 MWHERE~                                           
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: peace

Peace causes all characters in a room to stop fighting. It also strips
the AGGRESSIVE bit from mobiles.
~

92 POOFIN POOFOUT~                                    
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: poofin  <message>
        pooffout <message>

The standard messages for goto are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and
'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with
messages of your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.
These messages must include your name somewhere in the string.

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.
(see also goto)
~

95 LOG SNOOP~                                         
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Syntax: log   <character>
        log   all
        snoop <character>

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be
accompanied by mail to Kyle.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely,
certain commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does
not persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell Kyle.

For more information, see the help files for each race (i.e. 'help dwarf')
~

-1 DWARF DWARVES~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Dwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper and great
stamina.  Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor
dexterity. They are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to
their long lifespans.  Dwarves make excellent fighters and priests, but
are very poor mages or thieves.  

Dwarves are resistant to magic, poison and disease, but cannot swim, and
so are very vulnerable to drowning.  They recieve the berserk skill for
free (if warriors), and can see in the dark with infravision.
~ 

-1 ELF ELVES~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Elves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build.
They lack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are for more
agile, both in body and mind.  Elves are superb mages and thieves, but
have at best fair talent as warriors or priests.

Elves resist charm spells most effectively, due to their magical nature.
However, they are burned by the touch of iron, and so are barred from the
use of iron or steel in their adventuring careers.  Elves are notoriously 
hard to spot, and so elven warriors and thieves recieve the sneak and
hiding automatically. They may see in the dark with infravision.
~

-1 HUMAN HUMANS MAN~
Humans are the most common race in the world, and make up the majority of
adventurers. Although they have no special talents like the other races,
they are more versitile, being skilled in all four classes. Humans may
also train their primary stat higher than any other race, and are able to
gain more benefit from magical devices.
~

-1 GIANT GIANTS~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Giants are the largest of the races, ranging from 9-12 feet in height.
They are stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as the
dwarves. They aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes them
more clumsy than the other races.  Giants make the best warriors of any
race, but are ill-suited for any other profession.

Giants resist heat and cold with nary a mark, due to their huge mass.
However, their slow minds make them extremely vulnerable to mental
attacks.  Giants, due to their size and stamina, receive the fast
healing and bash skills for free. (Only giant warriors receive bash).
~

-1 WANDS STAVES SCROLLS~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Magical items require training to use properly.  If your character lacks
the necessary skill to use an item, he will fail, possibly destroying it.
The item skills are as follows:

The ROM skill system allows you to fully customize your new character,
making him or her skilled in the skills you choose.  But beware, the
skills you pick at character creation are the only skills you will ever
learn.  Skills are paid for with creation points, and the more creation
points you have, the harder it is to gain a level.  Furthermore,
higher-cost skills are harder to practice.

Skill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or
spells that are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit.
There is a default skill group for each class, which can be selected
for a balanced selection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.

The experience breakdown is as follows: 
points   exp/level     points   exp/level
40        1000         90        6000
50        1500         100       8000
60        2000         110      12000
70        3000         120      16000 
80        4000         130      24000
The table continues in a similar manner for higher point totals.

Mages have the highest-powered magic of any class except mystics, and is
one of the only classes able to use the draconian and enchanting spell

-1 CLERIC 'CLERIC BASICS' 'CLERIC DEFAULT'~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Clerics are the most defensively orientated of all the classes.  Most of
their spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few
combat spells being far less powerful than those of mages. However,
clerics are the best class by far at healing magics, and they posess
an impressive area of protective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.

-1 THIEF 'THIEF BASICS' 'THIEF DEFAULT'~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Thieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other
class, but have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves are
specialists at thievery and covert actions, being capable of entering
areas undetected where more powerful adventurers would fear to tread.
They are better fighters than clerics, but lack the wide weapon
selection of warriors.

All thieves begin with the dagger combat skill, and are learned in steal
as well.  Any other weapon skills must be purchased, unless the default

~

-1 WARRIOR 'WARRIOR BASICS' 'WARRIOR DEFAULT'~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Warriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best
fighters of all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and
the magical talents of mages and priests.  Warriors are best for those
who don't mind taking the direct approach, even when another method
might be called for.

Warriors begin with skill in the sword, and gain a second attack in
combat. Other weapon skills may be purchased cheaply, or gained in the
default skill package, which includes the following:

-1 AVENGER 'AVENGER BASICS' 'AVENGER DEFAULT'~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Avengers are like paladins, but are evil instead of good.  Avengers hate
good, and destroy it ruthlessly.  They are bloodthirsty, sneaky,
dishonest, and totally self-centered.  Avengers specialize in the injury
and pain of others and find it nearly impossible to heal themselves.

skill package, which includes the following:

Nightblades are closely related to thieves, but with the additional
benefit of reduced spell costs.  Nightblades can learn spells better
than thieves but are slightly less adept in physical combat.  Nightblades
are less interested in wealth than thieves, and more interested in power
and stealth.

in dodge and sneak as well.  The default skill package includes:

the only classes able to use the draconian and enchanting spell groups.

-1 EXOTIC WEAPONS WEAPON WEAPONSMASTER AXE DAGGER FLAIL MACE POLEARM SPEAR SWORD WHIP~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Each weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and
determines how well a character fights with a particular weapon.  The
weaponsmaster group provides talent in all weapons (save exotics), from
chair legs to halberds. If the character has the parry skill as well, he
can parry incoming attacks. The chance of parrying is best if the character
in question is skilled at both his weapon and his opponent's.

~

-1 'SHIELD BLOCK'~
Shield block is a rather fancy name for the art of parrying with a shield.
Characters with no shield block skill will not be able to defend themselves
well with a shield.  All classes may learn shield block, but only warriors and
clerics are good at it.  Beware, flails ignore shield blocking attempts, and
whips have an easier time getting around them.  Axes may split shields in two.
~

-1 ATTACK~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The attack spells are essentially powerful curses, fueled by divine
energy rather than magical power (like the combat spells are). They are
less powerful than the combat spells, but can still deal out a stinging
blow.  Mages and thieves cannot use this group.  The attack spell group
consists of the following spells:

demonfire      a powerful, but very evil, spell

~

-1 COMBAT~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
These sorcerous spells are, in the words of one famous mage, just 'more
ways to toss energy around'.  They are the most powerful of the damaging
spells, and considered an essential part of most wizards' collections.

The Draconian spell group deals with the magic of dragons -- in this
case, bringing forth the devastating power of their breath weapons upon

Backstab is the favored attack of thieves, murderers, and other rogues.
It can be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing

The bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to
knock your foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors,
including the bash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.
Bashing a dragon is not generally a wise idea.
~

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Only powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane
rage in combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell

safety.

-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Consider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever 
combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.
The blindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.
Dexterity helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  Only warriors and
thieves may learn this skill.
~

-1 DISARM~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Disarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your
opponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs
when you are skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon. Only
talented thieves and warriors may learn this skill.
~

-1 DODGE~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
In the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to
not be where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by
improving the character's natural agility to the point where many blows
will miss the target. The chance of dodging is also affected by the
dexterity of the attacker and the target.  Any class may learn dodging.
~

-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Warriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that
they are able to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage
is checked for with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of
receiving a bonus is very low indeed.
~

-1 'HAND TO HAND'~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard.  Learning
this style of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed --
bare hands. Trained hand to hand experts are far more effective than
many swordsmen. Clerics and warriors are the best at this skill,
although thieves and mages may also learn it.
~

-1 KICK~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Kicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a
powerful kick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off
balance.  Fighters and clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although
thieves may also learn it.
~

-1 PARRY~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
If at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting 
attacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a
weapon for full success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but
results in reduced damage instead of no damage.  The best chance of
parrying occurs when the defender is skilled in both his and his
opponent's weapon type.
~

-1 RESCUE~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with
the rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to
intercede in combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm.
Hopefully the favor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on
the skill rating, as well as a comparision of level, dexterity, and
speed between the character and the target. (note: you rescue a friend,
not the monster)
~

-1 TRIP~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Back by popular demand.  Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and
involves using any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent
down to the ground. Tripping large monsters is generally not a good idea,
and agile ones will find the attack easy to avoid.  Thieves and warriors
may learn trip.
~

-1 'SECOND ATTACK'~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Training in second attack allows the character a chance at additional
strikes in combat -- allow a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2
attacks every round.  Any class may learn this skill, although clerics
and mages have a very hard time with it.
~

-1 'THIRD ATTACK'~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Training in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional
strike in a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.
Perfect third attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.  Only
warriors and highly skilled thieves may learn this skill.
~

-1 HIDE SNEAK~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Hide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.
Hide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the
character remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to
sneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.  Only warriors and
thieves may learn these skills.
~

-1 'FAST HEALING'~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking,
resting, or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just
general toughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and
it is possible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but
mages find it very difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.
~

-1 LORE~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Lore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends.
Use of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an
object, concerning its power and uses.  It also may occasionaly increase
the value of an object, because more will be known about its worth.
All classes may learn lore, although thives are best at it, and
warriors find it very hard to use.
~

-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character
to match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for
merchandise, or to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most
merchants are already very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined
adventurer had best guard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural
masters at haggling, although other classes may learn it as well.
~

-1 PEEK~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,
the better to use the steal command with.  More intelligent characters
are harder to peek at.  All characters may learn peek, but thieves are
the most common practicioners.
~

-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Lock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to
gain access to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by  
intelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes
may learn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy.
~

-1 MEDITATION~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
This skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration
and mantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or
resting.

Thieves and warriors, with their troubled minds and violent attitudes,
have much trouble learning to meditate.
~

-1 STEAL~
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Theft is the defining skill of the thief, and is only available to that
class. It allows items to be stolen from the inventory of monsters and
characters, and even from shops!  But beware, shop keepers gaurd their
merchandise carefully, and attempting to steal from a character earns
you a THIEF flag, if you are caught (making you free game for killing).

 Channels are a means of global communication with other players.    
 When you speak on a channel, everyone who is listening to that      
 channel will here you.  Swearing or SPAMming on a public channel    
 may cause an immortal to block you from speaking on or hearing      
 any channels.  This is called nochanneling.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 Spam is the act of overloading a CHANNEL or other publicly seen     
 place with lots of text, causing others' screens to scroll by too   
 quickly to be read.  SPAM is considered extremely rude, and if you  
 a player does it in excess, they WILL be punished.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 FOLLOW starts you following another character (player or mobile).
 You can only follow someone you can see.  For instance, if the      
 character you are following enters a dark room, and you are not     
 holding a light, you will be unable to follow.  To stop following   
 anyone else, just FOLLOW yourself.

 <name> must be FOLLOWing you before you can add them to your group

 Characters may also leave your group by using the FOLLOW command to 
 stop following you.
