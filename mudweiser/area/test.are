Great Marble Gateway~
Before you stands the entrance to a large and majestic palace.
Quicly surveying the surrounding area, you marvel at the beauty
and wonder that create this alluring atmosphere, beckoning you
to enter the marvelous gateway and experience the pleasures that
await your arrival.  Through the northern gate, you hear sounds
or all sorts arousing your curiosity as to what event might be
taking place.

The Market~
People brush up against you from every direction as you walk
through, what appears to be, the central courtyard.  The crowds
have, obviously, gathered here for their daily shopping needs,
some light-hearted conversation, and a pleasant stroll in the
sun. To the north you see a large covered balcony extending
from the palace and strethching to the eastern and western 
buildings surrounding you.  Below the balcony stand numerous 
pillars made of marble for support.  The courtyard continues in
all directions.

Chapel of Love~
The Chapel of Love, admistered by the Reverend Bob, is the local wedding
chapel.  The ceiling is 20 feet high, and the walls are covered with stained
glass, depicting scenes from Romeo & Juliet and other romances.  Light is
provided by hundreds of candles about the room, and soft organ music is
playing.  Eight rows of pews face the altar, with an aisle down the center.
