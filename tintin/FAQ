This document will hopefully answer most questions regarding tintin++ (tt++).

Last updated: 03/07/2020

Q00) I'm new to tintin, how do I get started?

A00) Quite easy, start tintin using tt++ or ./tt++, to connect to a mud type:

     #session <name> <mud address> <mud port>

     The name can be whatever you want it to be. If you start up 2 or more
     sessions you can switch between the sessions using #<name> or use
     #<name> [command] to have that session execute a command keeping the
     session in the background.

     Type #help for a list of help subjects, #help <subject> for more
     information.

Q01) What machines does tintin work on?

A01) Pretty much any UNIX machine with a modern compiler as well as Windows,
     Mac OS X, Android, and iOS.

Q02) What causes a part of a line to be missing sometimes?

A02) It's most likely caused by packet fragmentation. This problem can be
     solved by using:

     #config packet_patch 0.5

Q06) I can't get tintin compiled.  Where can I get more help?

A06) See the INSTALL file.

Q07) I still can't get tintin compiled?

A07) See the install section on the website for even more detailed help.
     A pre-compiled binary is only available for Windows.

Q08) I would like to help, how can I contribute to tintin?

A08) You can assist people on the discord channel and give bug reports or
     suggestions. A link to the beta version is available on the forum
     in the Beta Testing section, beta testing is very important to the
     continued development of TinTin++.

     TinTin++ is mostly a solo project and over 95% of the code has been
     written by Igor van den Hoven. If you however feel the need to
     contribute a code snippet it should be released into the public
     domain, this to avoid weird situations where someone who contributed
     0.1% of the code demands 50% of the ownership.

     Another useful way to contribute is by working on tutorials, or
     writing interesting scripts for others to use.

Q09) Tintin is so awesome, how can I thank you guys for spending all that time
     to write tintin for free??

A09) Fan mail and donations are always welcome :)

Q11) Can I use code from tintin?

A11) Yes, provided that you follow the terms of the license.  The license
     used for tintin 1.86 till tintin 2.01.7 is GPL 2 and the license as of
     tintin 2.01.8 is GPL 3. TINTIN III and TinTin++ 1.5 are public domain,
     meaning there are no restrinctions whatsoever.

     The TinTin++ 1.5 official documentation by Robert Ellsworth was
     explicitly not released into the public domain, and subsequently it
     wasn't included in the GPL 2 and 3 tintin releases. 

Q12) I contributed code X, why isn't my name listed in the CREDITS file?

A12) Most likely your name slipped by before Davin Chan started
     maintaining tintin and adding people to the CREDITS file. If you
     believe you have contributed code to tintin, please email me and
     let me know. Make sure to see if your code is still existent in this
     version as little of the original code has remained.


Q14) I've seen some nifty code and would like to use it in a different program.

A14) If you read the COPYING file you will see you are allowed to modify and
     redistribute this version as long as you make it clear you made changes,
     and what those changes are. If you want to use tintin code in another
     program not licensed under GPL 3 you need permission from the author.

     Make sure to see if the exact code you want to use isn't existent in older
     tintin++ versions before contacting me, because I obviously cannot give
     permission for code I didn't write :) Also notice that older tintin++
     versions are not licensed under the GPL.

Q15) My old script files do not work, is this a bug?

A15) Possibly, more likely your old script files do not work because a lot has
     changed. Try reading #help <command> about the subject. Also the new
     script parser more closely resembles the working of common scripting
     languages. Also try to look through the examples, they are supposed to
     work, and you might find out what you are doing wrong. Feel free to
     ask for help on the forum.

     The NEWS file lists most compatibility issues.

Q16) #prompt {string} does not work

A16) That's because the new syntax is: #prompt {string} {substitution}
     Read the help for the substitute command for more information.

Q17) I want to make an ALIAS that creates an ACTION, but both use %0, how to
     go about this?

A17) Use %%0 %%1 %%2 for the arguments of the nested action.

Q18) How to enable support for chinese muds?

A18  Use: #config charset ? to get a list of support character sets.

Q19) I use Mac OS X and ran tintin a few times, now every time I open a terminal
     window, it runs tintin automatically.

A19) You clicked "use settings as default" while running tintin. There's a few
     ways out of this, but the easiest is locating your terminal preference 
     (home : library : com.apple.Terminal.plist) and deleting it. You'll have
     to redo anyting custom you set up (screen size, colors, etc.), but it
     will get the terminal back to the default of loading into your home
     directory.

Q20) What is the recommended terminal emulator?

A20) TinTin++ is being developed to work properly with xterm.

Q21) What is the recommended font?

A21) The default unicode settings are configured to work with Consolas and the 
     mintty terminal for the Windows build.
