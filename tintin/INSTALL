INSTALLATION
------------

Installation should be easy; cd to the src/ directory, then type:

./configure

make install

If this went without errors or serious warnings type this to start tintin:

tt++

You might need to install the following libraries:

  pcre: pcre.org
  zlib: zlib.net
gnutls: gnutls.org

If you have any trouble with installing/compiling tintin you should check out
the install section on the website.

https://tintin.mudhalla.net/install.php

If that doesn't do the trick you can ask for assistance on the forum.


TERMINAL EMULATION
------------------

In order to run tintin full featured you will need a vt100 emulator. If your
OS doesn't use one per default it's suggested to install xterm.


STATIC LINKING
--------------

This is more so a note to myself to statically link PCRE on Cygwin.

$ wget ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/pcre-8.34.tar.bz2
$ tar xvf pcre-8.34.tar.bz2
$ cd pcre-8.34/
$ ./configure CC=i686-pc-mingw32-gcc CXX=i686-pc-mingw32-g++ --enable-jit --enable-unicode-properties --disable-shared
$ make
$ ./configure --libdir='../pcre-8.34' --includedir='../pcre-8.34'
