-1 MOTD~
. `YNew features `w(you can view this list any time with '`Gmotd`w')
    1. Mudweiser has returned! Kyle Boyd provided me with the source
       code, and areas, races, classes, skills, and other bits of
       Mudweiser have been incorporated here.
    2. The stock EmberMUD areas are still accessible. There are two
       Midgaards. By default you start in Mudweiser's Midgaard. You
       can travel between the two via a portal in the Temple Square.
       All rooms in the stock Midgaard are colored `Ggreen`w.
    3. You can now choose where you recall. Type '`Gbeacon`w' to set your
       recall point to the current room. If you get stuck, you can reset
       your beacon to the Temple of Mota with '`Gbeaconreset`w'.
    4. The Mudpi bot has been removed. However, healing rates are
       greatly increased while sleeping on the temple altar.

-1 STORY~
. In the beginning, there was ROM. (Actually, it was in February, but that's
 beside the point) Then, ROM was updated to ROM II, and for a while there
 were two ROMs, separate but not equal. Sadly, all good things must come to
 an end, and in a mighty flash of write heads, ROM I was taken from this earth.
 Now there is ROM II, the mightier of the two, and many mortals eager to 
 perish in the quest for glory. In further development, ROM II was released.

 Then came the EmberMUD team. That's where we are now...

 and fill it with some objects and then continue equiping the mobile. It is
 likely that resets will backfire if they are not carefully entered.

 If you wish to reset the room then use `Gedit room reset`w.

`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wThe gate spell is a powerful transportation magic that opens up a   
 portal between your character and another person or creature        
 somewhere else in the world. This portal will transport you and    
 any pet you might have, but not other members of your group.        
                                                                     
 Monsters recieve a save against gate, and monsters or players more  
 than 3 levels higher than you can not be gated to at all. God       
 and private rooms cannot be gated to, and no recall rooms cannot be 
 gated out of. Finally, all gods are immune to gate.

 `wOnce you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it. If the   
 fight is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE (You can also      
 RECALL, but this is less likely to work, and costs more experience  
 points than fleeing).                                               
                                                                     
 If you lose your connection during a fight, then your character will
 keep fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time. Your       
 chances of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much    
 more experience.

 `wWhen your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
 of Midgaard. Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
 together with all of your equipment. Your gold stays with you. 

 Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

 Following and groups are not affected by death.

 You lose experience points for dying. The amount you lose is half-way back to
 the beginning of your level. Thus if you have a bad day and die several times,
 the penalties won't clobber you.

 Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
 Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (10 minutes of real time).
 Only the player who died, or someone in the same group, can retrieve objects
 from a player's corpse.

 You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster

 You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

 There is a small amount of random variation in the amount of xp you recieve 
 from killing a certian mobile, although it is fairly consistant.

 You may type LEVEL or LEVELS at any time in the game to get a listing of
 how much xp you need to reach the next 4 levels in the game.

 Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
 often (15 minutes) if some one is. Also note that objects lying on the ground

 `wBefore you can cast a spell, you have to practice it. The more you practice,
 the higher chance you have of success when casting. Casting spells costs mana.
 The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

 The <target> is optional. Many spells which need targets will use an
 appropriate default target, especially during combat.

 If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
 Example: cast 'cure critic' frag. Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
 You can abbreviate the spell name.

 When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
 The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
 saving throw successfully.

 `wTRAIN increases one of your attributes. When you start the game, your
 character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
 initial training sessions. You can increase your attributes by
 using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

 It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase
 mana or hp by 10. You receive one session per level.

 The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON. WIS gives you more
 practice when you gain a level. CON gives you more hit points.

 WIS and CON before practising or training anything else. INT gives you

	ban     <site>
	permban <site>

 BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in. BAN with
 no arguments lists the banned sites. ALLOW <site> removes a site from
 the ban list. Ban <site> defaults to ban <site> all. This type of ban is
 only temporary and will be removed upon a reboot.

 PERMBAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in. BAN with
 no arguments lists the banned sites. ALLOW <site> removes a site from
 the ban list. permban <site> defaults to permban <site> all. This type of
 ban is permanent and should not be used unless you consult with the entire
 mud staff.


 The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
 all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

 Valid ban types are as follows: newbie, permit, all.

90 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~
. `GREBOOT                                                                `Yadmin
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
	`wshutdown

 Reboot shuts down the server. When the normal 'startup' script is used
 to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
 old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

 Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
 from restarting it.

 Never, ever, shutdown the mud without consulting Zak.

90 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
. `GWIZLOCK
 NEWLOCK                                                               `Yadmin
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wWizlock and newlock both block login attempts. Wizlock locks
 out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 51), except for link-dead players who
 are returning. Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically
 used for preventing a spammer from returning. Wizlocking should be avoided.

 A god must be at least Supreme level to wizlock the game.
~
90 DENY~
. `GDENY <name>                                                           `Yadmin
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wDeny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character
 name unusable. It may only be removed by editing the file, for this reason
 freeze is usually preferred.
~
90 DISCONNECT~
. `GDISCONNECT <name>                                                     `Yadmin
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wDisconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
 prompt. This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
 players.
~
90 FREEZE~
. `GFREEZE <name>                                                         `Yadmin
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wFREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
 commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a 
 troublemaker is usually a better option than the deny command.
~
90 FORCE~
. `GFORCE [mob|char] <name> <command>

`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wFORCE forces one character or mob to execute a command, except of course delete.

 Below level 57 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is
 unavailable. You also cannot 'force mob orc murder hugo', for example. 

 FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
 This is typically used for 'force all save'.

 FORCE 'players' forces all players (not Imms) to execute a command.

 FORCE 'gods' forces all Imms of a lower level to execute a command.

90 SOCKETS~
. `GSOCKETS <name>
 SOCKETS                                                               `Yadmin
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wSOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including 
 users in the process of logging in. The two numbers inside brackets are the 
 channel number and the 'connected' state. The 'connected' states are listed in 
 merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

 The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
 to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
 into an orc).

`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wThe load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to 
 duplicate strung items and mobs). The vnums can be found with the vnum
 command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

 Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are
 put in the room. Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god.

	`wnoemote   <character>
	noshout   <character>
	notell    <character>

 Noemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by
 preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
 Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
 forms of communication.

 The nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
 from using any of the channels (gossip, auction, Q/A, music) on the game.
 Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.
~
90 PARDON~
. `GPARDON <character> KILLER/THIEF                                       `Yadmin

 `wPARDON pardons a player for their crimes. Don't pardon a player unless you
 are sure they deserve it. Being killed by Bob or Biff acts as an automatic
 pardon.

`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wPurge is used to clean up the world. Purge with no arguments removes all the
 NPC's and objects in the current room. Purge with an argument purges one
 character from anywhere in the world.

 Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag
 set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Biff). Mobiles and 
 objects may be purged if they are called directly by name.

`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wRestore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
 target character. It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

 Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player
 in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
 is only usable by creators and implementors. Restore should be used sparingly
 or not at all.
~
90 SLAY~
. `GSLAY <character>                                                      `Yadmin

`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wTransfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
 to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all 
 should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
 horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer. 
~
90 AT~

`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wAt executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
 location. The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
 a mobile, or as the name of an object.

 At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
 command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
 location).

`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wThese commands all perform similar functions. Echo sends the message to
 all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
 it. Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
 sends the message to the player specified as the target. Any higher-level
 god will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it
 is an echo.
~
90 GOTO~
. `GGOTO <location>                                                       `Yadmin

 `wGoto takes you to a location. The location may be specified as a vnum,
 as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

 You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
 already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
 already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain
 god level.

`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wHolylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
 mobile in the game. With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
 easily. Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

 Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will mke you invisible to all players of
 a lower level than your invisibility level. It defaults to the maximum
 (your level) if no argument is given. Wizi 60 characters are totally 
 invisible.

`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wMemory reports the size of your mud.

 The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
 not the number of instances currently in the game.

 The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings. These strings have
 a maximum limit, which is also shown.

 The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks. There is no limit
 on the number and size of these blocks.

 `wVNUM finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out
 the results. Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search. This vnum is
 very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
 the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name.

 `wThe stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
 within the game. Without a class argument, the command will return a object
 (if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room

 standing in. Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.

 `wLog <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
 the server's log file. Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
 Logs may only be used by creators and implementors.


 Certain commands (Password) are protected against log. Conversely, certain
 commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

 Log all logs all character commands. It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
 persist across reboots.

 Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.

 character at a time. Try to respect privacy.

        cast 'cancellation' <characte>
 
 Both of these spells remove magical effects from the target. Dispel magic
 has a reduced chance of working, and is considering an attack spell.
 Cancellation can only be used on allies, but is much more effective and does
 not provoke attack. Unfortunately, the spells do not discriminate between
 harmful and benign spells.
 
 The chance of dispelling is based on the level of the spell. Permanent spells
 (such as mobile sanctuary) are much harder to remove. Not all spells may
 be dispelled, notable examples are poison and plague.

-1 DWARF DWARVES~
. `BDwarf                                                                  `Yrace

 `wDwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper and great
 stamina. Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor dexterity.
 They are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long 
 lifespans. Dwarves make excellent fighters and priests, but are very poor
 mages or thieves.  

 Dwarves are resistant to magic, poison and disease, but cannot swim, and
 so are very vulnerable to drowning. They recieve the berserk skill for free
 (if warriors), and can see in the dark with infravision.
~
-1 ELF ELVES~
. `BElf                                                                    `Yrace
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wElves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build. They
 lack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are for more agile,
 both in body and mind. Elves are superb mages and thieves, but have at
 best fair talent as warriors or priests.

 Elves resist charm spells most effectively, due to their magical nature.
 However, they are burned by the touch of iron, and so are barred from the
 use of iron or steel in their adventuring careers. Elves are notoriously 
 hard to spot, and so elven warriors and thieves recieve the sneak and hiding
 automatically. They may see in the dark with infravision.

 `wHumans are the most common race in the world, and make up the majority of
 adventurers. Although they have no special talents like the other races,
 they are more versitile, being skilled in all four classes. Humans may
 also train their primary stat higher than any other race, and are able to
 gain more benefit from magical devices.

`w. Giants are the largest of the races, ranging from 9-12 feet in height. They
 are stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as the dwarves.  
 They aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy
 than the other races. Giants make the best warriors of any race, but are
 ill-suited for any other profession.

 Giants resist heat and cold with nary a mark, due to their huge mass. However,
 their slow minds make them extremely vulnerable to mental attacks. Giants,
 due to their size and stamina, receive the fast healing and bash skills for
 free. (Only giant warriors recive bash).

 `wMagical items require training to use properly. If your character lacks the
 necessary skill to use an item, he will fail, possibly destroying it. The
 item skills are as follows:

 scrolls		The reading of magical scrolls and books (see 'help recite')
 staves		The use of staves and similar devices (see 'help brandish')
 wands		The use of wands and similar items (see 'help zap')

. You customize your character by choosing which skills to add. Each skill
 costs a certain number of creation points (cp). You have 50 cp total to spend,
 and unspent points are converted into training sessions (2 cp = 1 train).

 Skill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or spells
 that are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit. There is a 
 default skill group for each class, which can be selected for a balanced 
 selection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.
~
-1 BASICS 'ROM BASICS'~
. The basic skills:

 Every character starts with two skill groups, one for their class and a default
 set that all characters receive. The default skills are:

 recall  	essential escape skill (see help recall)
 scrolls		reading of scrolls and other magical volumes
 staves		use of magical staves
 wands		use of magical wands

 for class defaults, check the classes themselves.
~
-1 MAGE 'MAGIC-USER' 'MAGE BASICS' 'MAGE DEFAULT'~
. Mages specialize in the casting of spells, offensive ones in particular.
 Mages have the highest-powered magic of any class, and are the only classes
 able to use the draconian and enchanting spell groups. They are also very
 skilled at the use of magical items, though their combat skills are the 
 weakest of any class.

 All mages begin with skill in the dagger. Any other weapon skills must be
 purchased, at a very high rate. The default skill selection for mages is
 as follows:

 skills:
 lore		the lore of magical items

 spell groups:
 beguiling	spells that control the mind
 combat		offensive magics, such as fireball and chill touch
 detection	informational magics, such as detect magic and identify
 enhancement	spells that maximize physical potential, such as haste
 illusion	magics for concealing and deceiving
 maladictions	a selection of curses fit for any witch
 protective	defensive magics, ranging from armor to stone skin
 transporation	spells for getting from here to there
 weather		spells for conjuring and mastering the elements
~
-1 CLERIC 'CLERIC BASICS' 'CLERIC DEFAULT'~
. Clerics are the most defensively orientated of all the classes. Most of their
 spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few combat spells
 being far less powerful than those of mages. However, clerics are the best 
 class by far at healing magics, and they posess an impressive area of
 protective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.

 All clerics begin with skill in the mace. Other weapon or shield skills must
 be purchased, many at a very dear cost. The default skill selection for 
 clerics is as follows:

 skills:
 flail		the proper use of flails

 spell groups:
 attack		a selection of offensive magics
 creation	the making of physical objects, such as food and water
 curative	spells that cure the sick and feeble of their ailments
 benedictions	powerful magics that grant the blessings of the gods
 detection	informational magics, such as detect magic and identify
 healing		spells for treating wounds, from scratches to death blows
 maladictions	an assortment of curses
 protective	defensive magics, including the powerful sanctuary spell
 transportation	spells for getting from here to there
 weather         spells for conjuring and mastering the elements
~
-1 THIEF 'THIEF BASICS' 'THIEF DEFAULT'~
. Thieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other class,
 but have the widest range of skills available. Thieves are specialists at
 thievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas undetected where
 more powerful adventurers would fear to tread. They are better fighters than
 clerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of warriors.

 All thieves begin with the dagger combat skill, and are learned in steal as 
 well. Any other weapon skills must be purchased, unless the default selection
 is chosen. This default skill package includes:

 skills:
 mace		the use of maces and other blunt weapons
 sword		swordplay and fencing
 backstab	the art of hitting your oponent by surprise
 disarm		used to deprive your oponent of his weapon
 dodge		the best way to take a punch is not to be there

 peek		used to look into a person's belongings
 pick lock	a useful skill for breaking and entering
 sneak		with this skill, a thief can walk into a room undetected
~
-1 WARRIOR 'WARRIOR BASICS' 'WARRIOR DEFAULT'~
. Warriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best fighters
 of all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the magical
 talents of mages and priests. Warriors are best for those who don't mind
 taking the direct approach, even when another method might be called for.

 Warriors begin with skill in the sword, and gain a second attack in combat.
 Other weapon skills may be purchased cheaply, or gained in the default skill
 package, which includes the following:

 skills:
 weaponsmaster	this group provides knowledge of all weapon types
 shield block	the art of parrying with a shield
 bash		a forceful rush with the body, designed to flatten your foes
 enhanced damage	this skill multiplies your damage in battle
 parry		the art of parrying with weapons
 rescue		allows you to take the blows aimed for a companion
 third attack	allows the skilled warrior to land three blows in one round
~
-1 EXOTIC WEAPONS WEAPON WEAPONSMASTER AXE DAGGER FLAIL MACE POLEARM SPEAR SWORD WHIP~
. Each weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and determines how
 well a character fights with a particular weapon. The weaponsmaster group
 provides talent in all weapons (save exotics), from chair legs to halberds.
 If the character has the parry skill as well, he can parry incoming attacks.
 The chance of parrying is best if the character in question is skilled at 
 both his weapon and his opponent's.

 The weapon skills consist of the following:

 weaponsmaster	skill group of all weapons listed below (save exotic weaponry)
 axe		the use of axes, ranging from hand to great (but not halberds)
 dagger		the use of knives and daggers, and other stabbing weapons
 flail		skill in ball-and-chain type weapons
 mace		this skill includes clubs and hammers as well as maces
 polearm		the use of pole weapons (except spears), including halberds
 spear		this skill covers both spears and staves, but not polearms
 sword		the warrior's standby, from rapier to claymore
 whip		the use of whips, chains, and bullwhips
 exotic		the use of strange magical weapons

 The exotic skill cannot be purchased, and is dependent soley upon level.

-1 'SHIELD BLOCK'~
. `GSheild block                                                  `Ypassive skill
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wShield block is a rather fancy name for the art of parrying with a shield.
 Characters with no shield block skill will not be able to defend themselves
 well with a shield. All classes may learn shield block, but only warriors and
 clerics are good at it. Beware, flails ignore shield blocking attempts, and
 whips have an easier time getting around them. Axes may split shields in two.
~
-1 ATTACK~
. `GAttack                                                          `Yspell group
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wThe attack spells are essentially powerful curses, fueled by divine energy
 rather than magical power (like the combat spells are). They are less powerful
 than the combat spells, but can still deal out a stinging blow. Mages and 
 thieves cannot use this group. The attack spell group consists of the 
 following spells:

 demonfire	a powerful, but very evil, spell
 dispel evil	torments evil foes
 earthquake	brings the power of earth to bear against your foes

`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wThese sorcerous spells are, in the words of one famous mage, just 'more ways to
 toss energy around'. They are the most powerful of the damaging spells, and
 considered an essential part of most wizards' collections. Clerics and thieves

 contains the following magics:

 magic missile	send a weak energy bolt into a foe

`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wThe illusions spells are dedicated to deception and trickery. They can be
 used to mask appearances, or create distractions for the party. Currently,
 the illusion group is very small, but it will be expanded in the future.
 Only thieves and mages can cast illusion spells, which consist of the 
 following:

 invis		turns the target invisible
 mass invis	turns the caster's group invisible
 ventriloquate	allows the caster to put words in someone's mouth
~
-1 MALADICTIONS~
. `GMaladictions                                                    `Yspell group
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wMaladictions are a group of curses and other baneful spells, designed to
 cripple, inconvinience, or torture, rather than kill outright. These spells
 may be case by any class.

 blindess	strikes the target blind
 change sex	turns the target into a new man (or woman)
 curse		prevents recalling and weakens the target in combat
 energy drain	drains experience and mana, while strengthening the caster
 plague		causes the target to suffer a slow, painful death from plague
 poison		weaker than plague, but often fatal
 weaken		drains the strength of the target
~
-1 PROTECTIVE~
. `GProtective                                                      `Yspell group
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wThe protective spells are used to shield against harm, whether from spells or
 physical attack. They range from the weak armor spell to the sought-after
 sanctuary charm. Also included in this group are several spells for dispeling
 hostile magics. Any class may use this group, which consists of the following 
 spells:

 armor		provides the target with an extra layer of defense
 cancellation	a powerful dispel, used for removing spells from friends
 dispel magic	removes spells from enemies, not as effective as cancel
 protection evil	provides defense from the attacks of evil creatures
 sanctuary	reduces all damage taken by the recipient by half
 shield		puts a shimmering shield between you and your enemies
 stoneskin	turns skin hard as stone, providing a huge armor boost
~
-1 TRANSPORTATION~
. `GTransportation                                                  `Yspell group
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wThe transportation group is used for travel, whether by flight, magical
 teleportation, or walking through walls. All classes may learn these spells,
 which are among the most useful in the game.

 fly		allows the target to fly over nearly all obstacles
 gate		transports the caster to the target
 pass door	allows the caster to walk through walls
 summon		transports the target to the caster
 teleport	sends the target to a random location
 word of recall	transports the caster to safety in Midgaard
~
-1 WEATHER~
. `GWeather                                                         `Yspell group
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wThese spells allow the caster to manipulate local weather conditions, as well
 as summon fog clouds, lightning, or even electrical glows. This group is
 usable by all classes.

 call lightning	summons a huge bolt from the heavens, if the weather is right
 control weather	changes the weather in the manner desired by the caster
 faerie fire	surrounds the target in a glowing aura
 faerie fog	reveals all hidden creatures in the room
 lightning bolt	sends a bolt of electricity into the target

 (the weather command, unrelated to this group, shows local weather conditions)
~
-1 BASH~
. `GBASH <victim>                                                  `Ycombat skill
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wThe bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock
 your foe to his knees. Its success depends on many factors, including the
 bash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent. Bashing a dragon
 is not generally a wise idea.
~
-1 BERSERK~
. `GBERSERK                                                               `Yskill
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wOnly powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage
 in combat. Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge
 surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  
 Berserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.
~
-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~
. `GDIRT <victim>                                                  `Ycombat skill
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wConsider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever 
 combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes. The
 blindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat. Dexterity
 helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick. Only warriors and thieves may
 learn this skill.
~
-1 DISARM~
. `GDISARM                                                         `Ycombat skill
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wDisarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your
 opponent of his weapon. The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you
 are skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon. Only talented thieves
 and warriors may learn this skill.
~
-1 DODGE~
. `GDodge                                                         `Ypassive skill
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wIn the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not
 be where it lands'. The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the
 character's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the 
 target. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the
 attacker and the target. Any class may learn dodging.
~
-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~
. `Genhanced damage                                               `Ypassive skill
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wWarriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that they are
 able to inflict more damage than other classes. Enhanced damage is checked
 for with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus
 is very low indeed.
~
-1 'HAND TO HAND'~
. `GHand-to-hand                                                  `Ypassive skill
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
`w. Hand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard. Learning this
 style of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.
 Trained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.
 Clerics and warriors are the best at this skill, although thieves and mages
 may also learn it.
~
-1 KICK~
. `GKICK                                                           `Ycombat skill
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wKicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful
 kick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance. Fighters
 and clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although thieves may also learn
 it.
~
-1 PARRY~
. `GParry                                                         `Ypassive skill
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wIf at first you fail to dodge, block it. Parry is useful for deflecting 
 attacks, and is succesful more often than dodge. Parry requires a weapon for
 full success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced
 damage instead of no damage. The best chance of parrying occurs when the
 defender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.
~
-1 RESCUE~
. `GRESCUE <character>                                             `Ycombat skill
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wA friend in need is a friend indeed. And when in combat, a warrior with
 the rescue skill is just the friend you need. Rescue allows you to intercede
 in combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the
 favor will be returned. Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as
 well as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and
 the target. Note: you rescue a friend, not the monster.
~
-1 TRIP~
. `GTRIP <victim>                                                  `Ycombat skill
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wBack by popular demand. Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves
 using any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.
 Tripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will
 find the attack easy to avoid. Thieves and warriors may learn trip.
~
-1 'SECOND ATTACK'~
. `GSecond attack                                                 `Ypassive skill
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wTraining in second attack allows the character a chance at additional strikes
 in combat -- allow a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every
 round. Any class may learn this skill, although clerics and mages have a 
 very hard time with it.
~
-1 'THIRD ATTACK'~
. `Gthird attack                                                  `Ypassive skill
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wTraining in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike
 in a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well. Perfect
 third attack does NOT assure three attacks per round. Only warriors and highly
 skilled thieves may learn this skill.
~
-1 HIDE SNEAK~
. `GHIDE
 SNEAK                                                              `Ymovement
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
`w. Hide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.
 Hide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the
 character remains stationary. Sneak may be used when moving (including to
 sneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success. Only warriors and
 thieves may learn these skills.
~
-1 'FAST HEALING'~
. `GFast healing                                                  `Ypassive skill
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wThe fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,
 or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general 
 toughness and stamina. Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is 
 possible for it to fail. All class may learn this skill, but mages find it
 very difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.
~
-1 LORE~
. `GLORE <item>                                                           `Yskill
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
`w. Lore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use
 of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,
 concerning its power and uses. It also may occasionaly increase the value
 of an object, because more will be known about its worth. All classes may
 learn lore, although thives are best at it, and warriors find it very hard
 to use.
~
-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~
. `GHaggle                                                        `Ypassive skill
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wHaggling is an indispensable skill to the trader. It allows a character to
 match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,
 or to buy at the lowest possible cost. Unfortunately, most merchants are 
 already very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined adventurer had best 
 guard his treasure closely. Thieves are natural masters at haggling, 
 although other classes may learn it as well.
~
-1 PEEK~
. `GPeek                                                          `Ypassive skill
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wThe peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,
 the better to use the steal command with. More intelligent characters are
 harder to peek at. All characters may learn peek, but thieves are the most
 common practicioners.
~
-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~
. `GPICK <direction>                                                      `Yskill
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
`w. Lock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain
 access to many secured areas. Lock picking chances are improved by  
 intelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes may
 learn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy.
~
-1 MEDITATION~
. `GMeditation                                                    `Ypassive skill
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wThis skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and
 mantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.
 Thieves and warriors, with their troubled minds and violent attitudes, have
 much trouble learning to meditate.
~
-1 VICIOUS STRIKE~
. `GVicious strike                                                `Ypassive skill
`K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 `wVicious strike is a passive ability that gives a warrior's attack the chance
 to deal substantial extra damage. The increase in damage ranges from 50% to
 500%, depending on the warrior's level and skill, and depending on chance.
~
-1 STEAL~
. `GSTEAL <item> <victim>                                                 `Yskill

 `wTheft is the defining skill of the thief, and is only available to 
 that class. It allows items to be stolen from the inventory of    
 monsters and characters -- even from shops! But beware, shop      
 keepers gaurd their merchandise carefully!
