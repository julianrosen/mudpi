Mudpi is a online multiplayer text-based RPG, which runs on a
Raspberry Pi. There are three software components:

1. EmberMUD, the game itself
2. TinTin++, a MUD client
3. ttyd, a browser interface

The EmberMUD and TinTin++ source have been modified by JR. Some day
I might streamline the compilation process, but for now here is how to compile:
1. Compile EmberMUD with 'cd EmberMUD/src; make; cd ../..'
2. Compile TinTin++ with 'cd tintin/src; ./configure; make; cd ../..'
3. Compile ttyd with 'mkdir ttyd/build; cd ttyd/build; cmake ..; make;
     cd ../..'
Now, start EmberMUD with 'EmberMUD/src/startup 20495' (or whatever
port you want EmberMUD to listen on, if you use a different port be
sure to edit tintin/mud_config). Then start ttyd with
'ttyd/build/ttyd -p 16377 start.sh' (you should replace 16377
with whatever port you want ttyd to listen on). Now point your
browser to http://localhost:16377/. Enjoy!

Theoretically this should work on platforms other than the Raspberry
Pi, but I have been unable to compile on Ubuntu (of the three
components, I could only get TinTin to work).
