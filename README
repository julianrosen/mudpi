Mudpi is a online multiplayer text-based RPG. The base game is EmberMUD, with a number of modifications
by JR. The text is fed through a modified version of the MUD client
TinTin++ (running server-side), and the result is served through a browser
using ttyd.

Compile the source using
./compile.sh
Then start the mudpi server on port <port> using
./start <port>
Point your browser at http://localhost:<port>/ and enjoy the game! The
script will also generate a systemd unit file mudpi.service, which you
can move to /etc/systemd/system if you want to start and stop mudpi
as a service.

I run Mudpi on a Raspberry Pi, but I have also tested it on Ubuntu.
